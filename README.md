# Weekly Challenge #19 - Falling Breakout

**For this challenge, you need to implement the [classical Atari game Breakout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)) with a twist: the bricks must be going down in a way that makes the game fun to play.** It's always fascinated me how with so little compute early computer games were able to produce playable.
