# Weekly Challenge #19 - Falling Breakout

**For this challenge, you need to implement the [classical Atari game Breakout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)) with a twist: the bricks must be going down in a way that makes the game fun to play.** It's always fascinated me how with so little compute early computer games were able to produce playable.

### Winner:

* The winner for $150 is @michael-azogu! The game combines tetris and breakout and is super fun to play. My high score is 570, go try and beat it ;) https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-19-falling-breakout/issues/2

* In second place with $100 are @nikpundik! When you break a brick, it starts falling down and damages your launchpad. This removes all the downtime while the ball is in the air! https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-19-falling-breakout/issues/1

* In third place for $80 is @Uzo2005! Every few seconds there's another row of bricks that come down, this makes it a lot more challenging to complete the game. https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-19-falling-breakout/issues/3

* Honorable mention for @nicogs who has been nerd sniped and built a reinforcement learning algorithm to play breakout. Took 18 epochs to finish a level :) https://www.threads.net/@nicogs/post/C7kGTstt-Tf
